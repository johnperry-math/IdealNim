<h2><a name="idea">The idea</a> </h2>

Ideal Nim is a very simple example of an
&ldquo;impartial, two-player, perfect-information, combinatorial game&rdquo;
that challenges the mind while illustrating some advanced mathematical ideas.
It is difficult to defeat the computer even when you know what you&rsquo;re doing,
so when you manage it you should be proud of yourself.
<p/>
If you are familiar with Nim then you are familiar with the basic principles behind Ideal Nim.
More information on this appears in the section on
<a href="#mathematics">Mathematical ideas behind the game</a>.

<h2><a name="gameplay"/>Gameplay</h2>

<h3>Basic gameplay</h3>
Gameplay consists in selecting valid squares.
Once a player selects a valid square,
all squares &ldquo;northeast&rdquo; of it become invalid.
To help identify valid and invalid squares,
You can drag your finger across the board, and the square underneath your finger
will highlight over a valid square, or black out over an invalid square.
<p/>
<center><b><i>The player who takes the last valid square wins.</i></b></center>
<p/>
(Initially, valid positions are colored <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>,
while invalid positions are colored <span style="color:red;">red</span>.
This can be changed in the preferences.)

<h3>Hints</h3>
On odd-numbered levels you can ask for a hint, and
the computer will mark the square it would choose.
If the position is playable, then it is a winning move; that is,
<i>if you play according to the computer&rsquo;s hints, you will win.</i>
<p/>
Oftentimes, the computer will mark the lower left square, which is not playable!
In these cases, <i>no move will guarantee a win</i>, and the computer would choose a random square.
You might as well do the same&hellip;
or use one of at least two ways to cheat.

<h3>&ldquo;Thinking&rdquo;</h3>
Before the computer can move or give you a hint (assuming you ask for one)
it has to analyze the game board. This is both good news and bad news.
<p/>
<b>The bad news:</b>
Depending on the number of playable pieces,
<b>this analysis can take anywhere from a split second to several minutes.</b>
A message will pop up, indicating the computer&rsquo;s progress in analyzing the board,
indicating both a percentage and a ratio of positions analyzed.
<p/>
<b>The good news:</b>
Most of the thinking occurs before the 60% mark, and once it&rsquo;'s done,
and <b>the anlysis is complete</b>.
If you can wait that out at the beginning of the game,
it will be near-instantaneous from then on&hellip; unless you change the board size mid-game!
Even then, it shouldn&rsquo;t take as long after you&rsquo;ve played a few turns.

<h2><a name="options"/>Options</h2>

If you select the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; (wrench) icon in the toolbar, several options will appear,
along with some fairly detailed explanations. Here&rsquo;s a little more detail on how they work.

<ul>
    <li> <b>One arm behind my back</b> &mdash;
        If a winning move is available, the computer will find it.
        Now, a computer can think a lot faster than you,
        and is much better at keeping track of all possible locations.
        If you check this box, however, the computer will sometimes &mdash; <i>sometimes</i> &mdash;
        &ldquo;make a mistake&rdquo; and choose a random square
        even when it knows a different square would guarantee a win!
        (This does not affect the hints: the machine will be honest in those cases.)
        <p/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Level</b> &mdash; Each level offers a number of random configurations.
        The level&rsquo;s number is related to the number of &ldquo;southwest corners&rdquo;
        the region of playable squares will have.
        Levels 1-2 have only one corner; levels 2-3 have two corners; levels 3-4 have three corners,
        and so forth.
        <p/>
        <b>Even-numbered levels disable hints.</b>
        Each even-numbered level offer the exact same configurations as the level below,
        but the lack of a hint makes it harder to play.
        So, while ten levels are listed,
        there are really only five levels of different configurations.
        <p/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Board size</b> &mdash; In theory, the board could extend indefinitely to the northeast;
        that is, an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; game of Ideal Nim has an infinite game board.
        In practice, this is impossible to implement,
        especially if the computer is going to find the best move!
        As a result, this app limits the board size.
        The smallest board you can play on is 7&times;7,
        but you can extend it to 15&times;15.
        Keep in mind that <i>larger boards require much more time for the computer to analyze!</i>
        <p/>
        But, lookit: This gives you an opportunity to outwit the computer!
        On a finite board, the winning position can change
        by adding or removing rows to the north and east!
        Just keep in mind that the computer will have to re-analyze the board
        when you change the size, and this will require time.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="mathematics"/>Mathematical ideas behind the game</h2>

Ideal Nim is based on several major ideas in the mathematical fields of
<b>commutative algebra</b> and <b>combinatorial game theory</b>.

<ul>
    <li>
        The game board involves two <b>diagrams of monomial ideals</b>.
        Playable points correspond to an ideal <i>P</i>,
        while played points correspond to an ideal <i>G</i>.
        During gameplay, <i>G</i> expands until it meets <i>P</i>.
        The game is inspired by what happens to monomial ideals
        during the computation of a Gr&ouml;bner basis.
        (You can read about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_ideal">monomial ideals</a> and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrÃ¶bner_basis">Gr&ouml;bner bases</a> here.)
    </li>
    <li>
        The fact that this game cannot go on indefinitely,
        regardless of the gameboard&rsquo;s dimension,
        is called either <b>the Hilbert basis theorem</b> or <i>Dickson&rsquo;s Lemma</i>,
        depending on how you look at it, and is possible because &ldquo;polynomial rings&rdquo;
        possess what is called the <b>Noetherian property</b>.
        (You can read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Dickson">Leonard Dickson</a>, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether">Emmy Noether</a> if you like.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Ideal Nim illustrates these ideas in the framework of an impartial, two-player,
        perfect-information, combinatorial game. What does this mean?<p/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Impartial</b> means that any move available to one player
                is also available to the other.
                The only difference between the players is whose turn it currently is.
                Any player the computer makes, you could also make if it were your turn instead.
                <p/>
                Chess is an example of a &ldquo;non-impartial game&rdquo;,
                properly called &ldquo;partizan&rdquo;,
                because you can&rsquo;s move your opponent&rsquo;s pieces.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Two-player</b> is probably obvious.<p/></li>
            <li>
                <b>Perfect-information</b> means that all information about the game
                is equally available to all players.
                In theory, the computer knows nothing more than you about Ideal Nim.
                The computer&rsquo;s only advantage
                is that it can &ldquo;think&rdquo; faster and more carefully than you.
                <p/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Combinatorial</b> means that the game&rsquo;s structure is <i>discrete</i>
                and <i>countable</i>; that is, you could in theory analyze the game using integers.
                <p/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        (You can read more about
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory">combinatorial games</a>
        if you like.)
