# Privacy Policy

To our knowledge, the Ideal Nim app
collects no data on the user and reports no data to any website.

The source code is available online (probably at the same site
where you found this file) so anyone can verify this by inspection.

We wouldn't even create this file, but Google requires it
to continue listing the app on the Google Play Store.
