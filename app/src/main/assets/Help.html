<h2><a name="idea">The idea</a> </h2>

Ideal Nim is a very simple example of an
&ldquo;impartial, two-player, perfect-information, combinatorial game&rdquo;
that challenges the mind while illustrating some advanced mathematical ideas.
It can be difficult to defeat the computer even when you know what you&rsquo;re doing,
so when you manage it you should be proud of yourself.
<p/>
If you are familiar with Nim, then you are familiar with the basic principles behind Ideal Nim.
More information on this appears in the section on
<a href="#mathematics">Mathematical ideas behind the game</a>.

<h2><a name="gameplay"/>Gameplay</h2>

This section is divided into two subsections:
<ul>
    <li><a href="#basic">Basic gameplay</a></li>
    <li><a href="#hints">Hints and game values</a></li>
    <li><a href="#thinking">&ldquo;Thinking&rdquo;</a></li>
    <li><a href="#human">Playing a human</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="basic">Basic gameplay</a></h3>
A game of Ideal Nim takes place on a finite gameboard
(but see a remark in the <a href="#options">discussion of options</a>).
Gameplay consists in selecting valid squares.
Once a player selects a valid square,
all squares &ldquo;northeast&rdquo; of it become invalid.
To help identify valid and invalid squares,
you can drag your finger across the board, and the square underneath it
will change color according to whether the square is valid.
By default, black is invalid, but you can change this in the <a href="#options">Options</a>.
<p/>
<center><b><i>The player who takes the last valid square wins.</i></b></center>
<p/>
(Initially, valid positions are colored <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>,
while invalid positions are colored <span style="color:red;">red</span>.
This can be changed in the preferences.)

<h3><a name="hints">Hints and game values</a></h3>
On odd-numbered levels, when you play the computer, you can ask for a hint, and
the computer will mark the square it would choose.
(Hints are not available when playing a human.)
If the position is playable, then it is a winning move; that is,
<i>if you play according to the computer&rsquo;s hints, you will win.</i>
<p/>
Oftentimes, the computer will mark the lower left square, which is not playable!
In these cases, <i>no move will guarantee a win</i>, and the computer would choose a random square.
You might as well do the same&hellip; or employ one of at least two methods to cheat.
(We drop hints on these methods here and there.)
<p/>
The computer will also indicate the game&rsquo;s <b>value</b>,
which is a &ldquo;nimber&rdquo; (not a &ldquo;number&rdquo;).
Nimber arithmetic is consistent but unusual: you have
4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 and thus both
6&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and 4&nbsp;+&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.
While an understanding of nimber arithmetic will help you immensely,
it is not strictly necessary.
(You can read more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimber">nimbers</a> if you like.)

<h3><a name="thinking">&ldquo;Thinking&rdquo;</a></h3>
Before the computer can move or give you a hint (assuming you ask for one)
it has to analyze the game board. This is both good news and bad news.
<p/>
<b>The bad news:</b>
Depending on the number of playable pieces,
<b>this analysis can take anywhere from a split second to several minutes.</b>
A message will pop up, indicating the computer&rsquo;s progress in analyzing the board
through both a percentage and a ratio of positions analyzed.
<p/>
<b>The good news:</b>
Once it&rsquo;s done, <b>the analysis is complete</b>.
If you can wait out that first analysis,
it will be near-instantaneous for the rest of that game.
<p/>
There is a remote possibility that in larger boards, your device will lack memory sufficient
to store the analysis, but for that matter'
your device will probably take far too long in the analysis, anyway!
The precise limit is device-dependent, so advance &ldquo;up the ladder,&rdquo; so to speak,
with caution.

<h3><a name="human">Playing a human</a></h3>
You can play a nearby human using Bluetooth!
To do so, touch the two-player icon in the toolbar.
The app will automatically enable Bluetooth if it is available on your device,
but you can only play a device with which you are already paired,
and the app will not pair two devices for you.
To pair two devices, go into your device&rsquo;s Settings (<i>not</i> the app&rsquo;s Options),
select Bluetooth, and select a device you want to pair.
Both you and your opponent must pair your devices before you can play!
<p/>
Once your devices are paired, you can decide whether to host or join a game.
One player will host the game, while the other player will join.
The player who joins has to play whatever game is on the host&rsquo;s device,
which puts him at a disadvantage, to counter that, the player who joins gets to go first.
<p/>
When the game ends, the Bluetooth connection is disconnected, but Bluetooth is left on.
If you want to play again, you will need to touch the two-player icon again,
and decide whether to host or join again. (You will not need to re-pair your devices.)
If you do not want to play again, you should probably turn off your Bluetooth radio
unless you&rsquo;re using it with other devices.
You can do that in your device&rsquo;s Settings (<i>not</i> the app&rsquo;s Options).

<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>

<h2><a name="options"/>Options</h2>

If you select the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; (wrench) icon in the toolbar, several options will appear,
along with some explanations. Here&rsquo;s a little more detail on how they work.

<ul>
    <li> <b>One arm behind my back</b> &mdash;
        If a winning move is available, the computer will find it.
        Now, a computer can think a lot faster than you,
        and is much better at keeping track of all possible locations.
        If you check this box, however, the computer will sometimes &mdash; <i>sometimes</i> &mdash;
        &ldquo;make a mistake&rdquo; and choose a random square
        even when it knows a different square would guarantee a win!
        <p/>
        (This does not affect the hints: the machine will be honest in those cases.
        &mdash; Unless there&rsquo;s a bug in the program, of course,
        but we&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time on debugging, honest!)
        <p/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Level</b> &mdash; Each level offers a number of random configurations.
        The level&rsquo;s number is related to the number of &ldquo;southwest corners&rdquo;
        the region of playable squares will have.
        Levels 1-2 have only one corner; levels 2-3 have two corners; levels 3-4 have three corners,
        and so forth.
        <p/>
        <b>Even-numbered levels disable hints.</b>
        Each even-numbered level offers the same configurations as the previous odd-numbered level,
        but the lack of a hint can make it harder to play.
        So, while ten levels are listed,
        there are really only five levels of different configurations.
        <p/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Board size</b> &mdash; In theory, the board could extend indefinitely to the northeast;
        that is, an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; game of Ideal Nim has an infinite game board.
        In practice, this is impossible to implement, so the app limits the board size.
        The smallest board you can play on is 7&times;7, but you can extend it to 20&times;20.
        In some cases, this may allow you to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat,
        as the computer&rsquo;s analysis is limited to much less than 20&times;20,
        so in some cases it may prefer a position that is not, in fact, the best one!
    </li>
</ul>

<p/>
<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>

<h2><a name="mathematics"/>Mathematical ideas behind the game</h2>

Ideal Nim incorporates ideas from
<b>commutative algebra</b> and <b>combinatorial game theory</b>.

<ul>
    <li>
        The game board involves two <b>diagrams of monomial ideals</b>.
        Playable points correspond to an ideal <i>P</i>,
        while played points correspond to an ideal <i>G</i>.
        During gameplay, <i>G</i> expands until it agrees with <i>P</i>.
        This resembles what happens to a &ldquo;leading monomial ideal&rdquo;
        during the computation of a Gr&ouml;bner basis.
        (You can read about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_ideal">monomial ideals</a> and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrÃ¶bner_basis">Gr&ouml;bner bases</a> if you like.)
        <p/>
    </li>
    <li>
        The fact that this game cannot go on indefinitely,
        regardless of the gameboard&rsquo;s dimension,
        is due to <b>the Hilbert basis theorem</b>, or <b>Dickson&rsquo;s Lemma</b>,
        depending on how you look at it. These apply because &ldquo;polynomial rings&rdquo;
        are <b>Noetherian</b>.
        (You can read more about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Dickson">Leonard Dickson</a>, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether">Emmy Noether</a>, and
        the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noetherian_ring">Noetherian rings</a>
        if you like.)
        <p/>
    </li>
    <li>
        Ideal Nim illustrates these ideas in the framework of an impartial, two-player,
        perfect-information, combinatorial game. What does this mean?<p/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Impartial</b> means that any move available to one player
                is also available to the other.
                The only difference between the players is in whose turn it is.
                Any play the computer makes on its turn, you could also make if it were your turn.
                <p/>
                Chess is an example of a &ldquo;non-impartial game&rdquo;,
                properly called &ldquo;partizan&rdquo;,
                because you can&rsquo;t move your opponent&rsquo;s pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Two-player</b> is probably obvious.
                (If it isn&rsquo;t, this might not be the right game for you.)
                <p/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Perfect-information</b> means that all information about the game
                is equally available to all players.
                In theory, the computer knows nothing more about the game than you do.
                The computer&rsquo;s only advantage
                is that it can analyze the game much faster and more carefully.
                <p/>
                Most card games are examples of &ldquo;non-perfect-information&rdquo; games,
                because you don&rsquo;t know your opponents&rsquo; cards.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Combinatorial</b> means that the game&rsquo;s structure is <i>discrete</i>
                and <i>countable</i>; that is, you could in theory analyze the game using integers.
                <p/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        (You can read more about
